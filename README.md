# GLB File Upload and Retrieval API

This project provides a Flask-based API for uploading and retrieving `.glb` files. It allows users to upload `.glb` files, automatically renames them based on the existing files in the folder, and retrieves a list of uploaded files.

## Features

- Upload `.glb` files to the server
- Automatically renames files (e.g., `Patient1.glb`, `Patient2.glb`, etc.)
- List all uploaded `.glb` files
- Retrieve individual files by name
